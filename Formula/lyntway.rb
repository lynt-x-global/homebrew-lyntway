# The three Lyntway command-line tools.
#
# They are installed together on purpose. `lyntway init` writes an MCP
# config that names lyntway-mcp, so a machine with the CLI and not the shim
# is one where setup appears to succeed and the evidence quietly has a hole
# in it. Installing a prebuilt archive rather than building from source
# keeps `brew install` to a few seconds, which is what the five-minute
# setup path depends on.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Start here. No account, no network call:

        lyntway          what AI software is on this machine, what your
                         agents can reach, and which of those have a
                         credential sitting in the config beside them

      Also with no account:

        lyntway-verify   checks a receipt, offline, forever
        lyntway-mcp      governs MCP tool results on this machine
        lyntway-dbgateway  receipts every query an agent runs against
                         PostgreSQL, MySQL or MongoDB. Content never
                         leaves the process.

      To route what is here and start recording what it sends:

        lyntway connect

      It shows you what it found and asks before changing anything.
      Everything it touches is backed up, and 'lyntway undo' reverses it.
