# The three Lyntway command-line tools.
#
# They are installed together on purpose. `lyntway init` writes an MCP
# config that names lyntway-mcp, so a machine with the CLI and not the shim
# is one where setup appears to succeed and the evidence quietly has a hole
# in it. Installing a prebuilt archive rather than building from source
# keeps `brew install` to a few seconds, which is what the five-minute
# setup path depends on.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Two of these need no account:

        lyntway-verify   checks a receipt, offline, forever
        lyntway-mcp      governs MCP tool results on this machine

      To point this machine's AI tools at a Lyntway service:

        lyntway login
        lyntway init

      It shows you what it found and asks before changing anything.
      Everything it touches is backed up, and 'lyntway undo' reverses it.
